## 🤨 What is it?

GitForest is a dynamic, visually driven GitHub profile enhancement that
turns your contribution history into a forest. The more you code, the
bigger the forest grows. The forest will be periodically reset to prevent
the forest from becoming to large however the data (how many forests you've
filled) will be stored and displayed. GitForest helps you visualize
consistency, progress and growth in a more organic, motivating and fun
way.

### 🌳 How Does the Forest Grow?

 - 🌲 One spruce = **25 commits**
 - 🌸 One cherry blossom tree = **10 pull requests**
 - 🪴 More coming soon...

### ✨ Features

 - 🌳 **Visual growth:** When you contribute more you see trees grow 
and new elements appear as the ecosystem grows
 - 📈 **Progress tracker:** See how many forests you've filled over time
 - 🛠️ **GitHub integration:** Works directly with your contribution data

### 🚀 Installation

1. Create a fork

14. Done! The ci script runs automatically every 10 minutes which is responsible for updating the svg
15. If you want to have it in your profile README go to assets/forest.svg and copy the raw link to it then paste it 
in your README like this

### 🔧 Config

Currently only the background color can be customized. Please note that the background color
will actually update when the forest fills up or if the script runs for the first time.
Here are what they look like and what to type in BACKGROUND_COLOR variable:
- mystic or purple:
